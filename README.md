<h1>UDVARTANA SPORTS THERAPY & MASSAGE CLINIC</h1>
<p>
    This website has been developed as both a potential platform for acquiring customers for a future business venture
    (namely a Sports Massage and Complementary Therapy Clinic) and also as the first entry into a website portfolio, to
    attract potential customers in similar fields.
</p>


<h2>UX</h2>
<p>
    A number of members of the general public were canvassed and asked to select 3 words from a list of 10
    and order them according to how they felt that these words described sports massage therapy.
    I used alliteration to provide an immediate sense of ease and continuity.
</p>
<p>
    The overall green colour scheme and use of plant imagery reinforce these ideas of vitality, health,
    and relaxation.  In addition, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Color-Design-Workbook-World-Graphic/dp/1592534333">Color Design Workbook</a> by Sean Adams, et. al.
    (2008, p.28) suggest that the positive symbolism attached to the colour include healing, growth, success and youth.
</p>
<p>
    The lack of navbar and collapsed menu were chosen to provide a feeling of space and freedom.  The cards on the landing page do not dominate but also create a sense
    of space. This is counterated by the use of box-shadows to break up, what would otherwise be a large amount of whitespace.

<h3>Content</h3>
<p>
    I owe a great deal to Jonas Schmedtmann and his Advanced CSS Course on Udemy.
    By following his course, I have learned how to compile Sass, and use variables and mixins.</br>
    I am particularly indebted to him for my website's navigation menu and icon, my use of the 
    checkbox hack and pseudo-classes, as well as the 'center-screen' mixin.
</p>
<p>
    Where possible, I have endeavoured to adapt the code to satisfy my own particular tastes, or the requirements of the project,
    rather than blindly copy it.  In some instances, however, I found no better way of realizing my vision
    in code; the 'center-screen' mixin, for example, is 100% Schmedtmann.
</p>
<p>
    Other resources that have proven exceedingly useful, include:
    <ul>
        <li>w3schools</li>
        <li>Mozilla Developer Network</li>
        <li>Stack Overflow</li>
        <li>freecodecamp</li>
        <li>Get BEM</li>
        <li>Code Institute (of course)</li>
        <li>Fellow students and the Slack channels</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    In all instances, where I have sought solutions to problems, I have read how others have approached the problem,
    taken inspiration and attempted to find my own way.  In so doing, I hoped to learn something.
